ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Nishan Bastola! I'm a Python Developer and Data Science enthusiast currently building my portfolio to showcase projects in machine learning, data analysis, and AI.

ðŸ’» Iâ€™m working on AutoBill, an AI-powered checkout system, and honing my skills in data manipulation, machine learning, and Python programming.

ðŸš€ Stay tuned for more projects as I develop my portfolio, and feel free to reach out for collaboration or feedback!
